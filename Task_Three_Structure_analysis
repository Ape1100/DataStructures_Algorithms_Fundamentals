###Data Structure Analysis


##Arrays:

#Pros:

Simple and fast access by index.

#Cons:
Inefficient for insertions and deletions.
Use Case: Suitable for small, static lists.

###Linked Lists:

#Pros:
Efficient insertions and deletions.

#Cons:
Slow access by index.

Use Case: Useful when frequent modifications are needed.

##Hash Tables:

#Pros:
Fast lookups for conversation metadata.

#Cons:
Inefficient for ordered access.

#Use Case: Useful for quick access by conversation ID.
Trees (AVL, Red-Black):

#Pros:
Efficient for ordered access and maintaining sorted lists.

#Cons:
More complex implementation.

#Use Case: Best for managing ordered lists of conversations.

###Recommended Data Structure:

Balanced Trees (AVL or Red-Black Trees): Efficient for managing ordered lists of conversations, enabling quick access, insertions, deletions, and sorted retrieval.
