###Real-Time Communication Techniques

#Polling:

#Pros:
Simple implementation.
#Cons:

Inefficient and resource-intensive due to constant checking.
Higher latency for real-time updates.

Use Case: Not recommended for real-time updates due to inefficiency.
Long-Polling:

#Pros:
More efficient than regular polling.
Better for near real-time updates.

#Cons:
Still incurs some latency and overhead.
Can be resource-intensive with high user loads.

#Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where WebSockets are not feasible.
WebSockets:

#Pros:
Provides a full-duplex communication channel.
Low latency and efficient for real-time updates.

#Cons:
More complex implementation.
Requires maintaining open connections, which can be resource-intensive.

#Use Case: Recommended for real-time updates due to low latency and efficient resource use.
Recommended Approach

#WebSockets: Best suited for real-time updates, offering low latency and efficient communication. It's highly scalable with proper infrastructure.
